#This is used if you have a situation where a pointer value points to a combination of text sequences instead of just one.
#Format is as follows: encoder.pointer.combination.[POINTER_INDEX]=[NUMBER_OF_SEQUENCES_TO_MERGE]
#In the example below at pointer index 2, we need to reference the 2nd text sequence + the following 3 for a total of 4 sequences.
